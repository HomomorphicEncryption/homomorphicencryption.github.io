We are developing a community standard for homomorphic encryption based on three white papers created by the standards’ meetings’ participants. 
The three white papers addressed *Security*, *API*, and *Applications* of homomorphic encryption. 
After a public comment period, including review by leading members of the community, the security white paper was publicly endorsed by many leading security experts at the [second standardization workshop](https://projects.csail.mit.edu/HEWorkshop/index.html), 
resulting in the first version of the *Homomorphic Encryption Standard*. 
Today, this document provides scheme descriptions, a detailed explanation of their security properties, and tables for secure parameters. 
Future versions of the standard may describe a standard API and a programming model for homomorphic encryption.

# Draft Standard Update
Every standards meeting we discuss potential updates to the standard.
This Google doc is a candidate update to the standard which contains mostly small updates.
We solicit comments on this draft update which we hope to vote on at future meetings. (January 7, 2019) [[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/106W-tFEbChJQfbqEE7PnIVqEBPzYD_pqrMn55UKDCOc/)]
