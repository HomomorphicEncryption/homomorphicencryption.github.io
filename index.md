# Homomorphic Encryption Standardization



Homomorphic Encryption provides the ability to compute on data while the data is encrypted.  This ground-breaking technology has enabled industry and government to provide never-before enabled capabilities for outsourced computation securely.

HomomorphicEncryption.org is an open consortium of industry, government and academia to standardize homomorphic encryption.

Please join our mailing list and participate in our standardization efforts.
