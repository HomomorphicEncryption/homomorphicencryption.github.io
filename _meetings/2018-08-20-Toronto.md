Based on the success of our inaugural standards meeting last summer, and the founding of the homomorphicencryption.org industry consortium, we are pleased to announce the next edition of our standards meeting. The goals of this meeting are to approve a draft standard for parameter selection for homomorphic encryption and revisit our initial API standard draft. We welcome new participants who wish to be a part of this homomorphic encryption standards community. This includes academics and researchers, as well as representatives from industry, government, and nonprofits from around the world.

The Standardization Workshop will be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA on March 15-16, 2018.

Location. MIT Stata Center, 32 Vassar Street, Room D-463 (Star), Cambridge MA 02139. For more detailed directions, see here.

Workshop Goals. The workshop has two main goals: (1) Approve a draft standard for parameter selection of homomorphic encryption; and (2) Build upon the API discussion from first workshop and outline steps forward.
