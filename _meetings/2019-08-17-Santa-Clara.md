The 4th meeting was held August 17, 2019 in Santa Clara, USA.

Based on the success of our previous standards meetings, and the founding of the HomomorphicEncryption.org group, we are pleased to announce the Fourth HomomorphicEncryption.org Workshop.
The workshop is targeted at application developers, security practitioners, and homomorphic encryption experts. 
Along with technical standards discussions, the program includes introductory sessions for more general audiences. 
The workshop is also a great place for PhD students to meet representatives from industry and academia. 
The main standardization goals of this meeting are to:
a) update the security standard
b) introduce scheme-specific white papers
c) discuss protocol standardization for applications.

**Date**: August 17, 2019

**Location**: Intel SC12, 3600 Juliette Ln, Santa Clara, CA 95054

**Lodging**: We are co-located with Usenix Security ’19, which is hosted in the Hyatt Regency Santa Clara.

## Contact
If you have any questions, please contact the organizing committee at contact@homomorphicencryption.org. 
As this will be an interactive workshop, we will try to have opportunities for participants to share information that is relevant and appropriate to the goal of approving a standard for parameter selection for homomorphic encryption. 
Please send us an email if you have something you would like to propose to present at the workshop.
